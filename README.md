The Two folders you see are two of the many different ways in which you can do text classification.

Support Vector Machine
It as an algorithm used in machine learning which categorizes two different data in two different modules.

To run this code you need to provide a dataset you can use the one already uploaded(stress.csv)

Then there are parameters for accuracy,for testing and training which can be changed and can also work without being changed.

At the end we can see a line to test the model where we can give it a line that is not present in dataset for the classification it was trained for and it provides the label that we need.
